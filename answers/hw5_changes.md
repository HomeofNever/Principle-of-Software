# Changes

I made no changes to my public APIs of class `Graph` in hw4.

But I do comment out the `checkRep()` method usage in my `Graph` class as it will loop through the whole graph each time I add a new edge to check my rep invariant. It is not necessary during the deployment so I comment it out.
